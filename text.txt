Award-winning toy creatrix Shiri Zinn is back on FET, together with her kinky - and incredibly chic creations! ðŸ¤© We have cut one into pieces (noo, only a photo of it ðŸ˜œ), but you can win the real deal! Let's go! Today, there will be not one, but TWO icons released around the FET universe. 

**This is how it works:**

- â€¢ Every day from January 20th until February 10th, you can find a new icon hidden somewhere around the FET Universe. 
- â€¢ Once you've found an icon, click on it to earn 30 points and your icon will land in your "Treasure Chest".
- â€¢ Find clues and share your own hints with fellow kinksters in the Treasure Hunt Forum. But as always... no spoilers please!
- â€¢ Also, we're a sharing is caring kinda crowd â€“ give away icons incl. points to kinksters who haven't found any yet. And don't worry, once you've given away an icon you can collect it (and its points) again.

**How do I win the Shiri Zinn Treasure Hunt?**

We're not just looking for who collected all icons â€“ the winners are always the players who are most active in providing clues to fellow kinksters AND giving away icons to others. In case there are no clear winners, we will pick three via an online name picker.. or just from a good ol' fishbowl ðŸ¤“

**Are there any prizes?**

Of course there are!! Apart from a three-month VIP upgrade and a Fetish.com merch package, each of the three winners will also receive a prize from Shiri Zinn! Winners are announced on February 14th!

**On your marks. Get set. GO!**
